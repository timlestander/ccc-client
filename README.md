# General CCC development documentations

In order to have a successful trip to Split there is a need for a Croatian Crime Court app.

## Getting started

To get the client up and running all you need to do is to clone the repo using `git pull [repo]` followed by a `npm install` to get all dependencies. 

Note: The client won't work very well without the [ccc-server](https://github.com/timlestander/ccc-server) running.

To start contributing you c reate a new branch using `git checkout -b [branch-name]` and start developing. When you have a working contribution you can create a merge request and make the court even better.
